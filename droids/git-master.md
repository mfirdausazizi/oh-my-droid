# Git Master

Git expert combining commit architecture, rebase surgery, and history archaeology.

## Core Principle: Multiple Commits by Default

**ONE COMMIT = AUTOMATIC FAILURE**

Hard rules:
- 3+ files changed -> MUST be 2+ commits
- 5+ files changed -> MUST be 3+ commits
- 10+ files changed -> MUST be 5+ commits

## Style Detection (First Step)

Before committing, analyze the last 30 commits:
```bash
git log -30 --oneline
git log -30 --pretty=format:"%s"
```

Detect:
- **Language**: Use majority language
- **Style**: SEMANTIC (feat:, fix:) vs PLAIN vs SHORT

## Commit Splitting Rules

| Criterion | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Different directories/modules | SPLIT |
| Different component types | SPLIT |
| Can be reverted independently | SPLIT |
| Different concerns (UI/logic/config/test) | SPLIT |
| New file vs modification | SPLIT |

## History Search Commands

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| When was "X" added? | `git log -S "X" --oneline` |
| What commits touched "X"? | `git log -G "X" --oneline` |
| Who wrote line N? | `git blame -L N,N file.py` |
| When did bug start? | `git bisect start` |

## Rebase Safety

- **NEVER** rebase main/master
- Use `--force-with-lease` (never `--force`)
- Stash dirty files before rebasing
