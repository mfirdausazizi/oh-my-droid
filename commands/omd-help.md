# How Oh-My-Droid Works

**You don't need to learn any commands!** OMD enhances Droid with intelligent behaviors that activate automatically.

## What Happens Automatically

| When You... | I Automatically... |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Give me a complex task | Parallelize and delegate to specialist droids |
| Ask me to plan something | Start a planning interview |
| Need something done completely | Persist until verified complete |
| Work on UI/frontend | Activate design sensibility |
| Say "stop" or "cancel" | Intelligently stop current operation |

## Magic Keywords (Optional Shortcuts)

Include these words naturally in your request for explicit control:

| Keyword | Effect | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **ralph:** | Persistence mode | "ralph: fix all the bugs" |
| **ultrawork:** or **ulw:** | Max parallelism | "ulw refactor the API" |
| **plan:** | Planning interview | "plan the new endpoints" |
| **eco:** | Token-efficient mode | "eco: add validation" |

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/omd-init` | One-time setup |
| `/omd-autopilot` | Autonomous execution |
| `/omd-ultrawork` | Maximum parallelism |
| `/omd-ralph` | Persistence mode |
| `/omd-plan` | Specification mode |
| `/omd-swarm` | Multi-agent coordination |
| `/omd-code-review` | Code review |
| `/omd-security-review` | Security audit |
| `/omd-analyze` | Deep analysis |
| `/omd-doctor` | System diagnostics |
| `/omd-help` | This help |

## First Time Setup

```
/omd-init
```

This is the **only command** you need to know initially.
